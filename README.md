## ABOUT ME ü§ù
Junior AI engineer/MLOps, songwriter, and filmmaker.

I live for research, discovery and the transmission of knowledge.

After obtaining my Data Science & AI certification at Le Wagon Paris in summer 2024, I greatly refined my skills working on 'teller' a personal AI and Text-to-Speech project, whose main goal is the effective integration of information, through an immersive and controlled auditory experience.
