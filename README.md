# ABOUT ME ü§ù
### Junior AI integration engineer/MLOps, songwriter and filmmaker.

### I live for research, discovery and the transmission of knowledge.

### After a few years of coding practice and obtaining my Data Science & AI certification at Le Wagon Paris in summer 2024, I greatly refined my skills working on 'teller', a personal AI and Text-to-Speech project, whose main goal is the effective integration of information, through an immersive, focus improving and controlled auditory experience.
