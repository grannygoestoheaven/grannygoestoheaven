# ABOUT ME 🤝
### AI integration Engineer/FullStack Developer - (songwriter and filmmaker).

### I live for research, discovery and the transmission of knowledge.

### After a few years of coding practice and obtaining my Data Science & AI certification at Le Wagon Paris in summer 2024, I greatly refined my skills working on 'teller', an AI and Text-to-Speech EdTech project, whose main goal attentive listening and discovery, through an immersive and controlled auditory experience.
